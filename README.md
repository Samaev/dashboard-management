# Dashboard-management Vue 3 + TypeScript

User Management Dashboard built with Vue 3 and Vite. Implements a users table (Name, Email, Status, Actions) with search (by name/email), status filter (All/Active/Inactive), loading and empty states, and a delete flow with confirm + success toast. Data is mocked with artificial delays (fetch: 1000 ms, delete: 500 ms). Composition API with TypeScript.
